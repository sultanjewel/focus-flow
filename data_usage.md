# Data Usage Compliance

## Data Collection and Usage
Focus Flow does not collect, store, or transmit any user data to external servers. All user data (tasks, settings, statistics) is stored locally on the user's device using Chrome's storage API.

## Third-Party Services
Focus Flow does not integrate with any third-party services, analytics tools, or tracking mechanisms.

## Data Security
Since all data is stored locally on the user's device:
1. We don't have access to any user data
2. No data is transmitted over the network
3. Data security is managed by Chrome's built-in security for extension storage

## User Data Rights
Users have full control over their data:
1. All data can be deleted by clearing browser storage or uninstalling the extension
2. No data is shared with third parties
3. No personally identifiable information is collected

## Compliance Statement
Focus Flow complies with all requirements in the Chrome Web Store Developer Program Policies, including:
- No collection of personally identifiable information
- No unauthorized use of permissions
- No obfuscated code
- No misrepresentation of functionality
- No unauthorized use of Chrome APIs

This extension is designed with user privacy as a priority, using only local storage and requesting only the permissions necessary for its core functionality.
